# üßæ Discounted Price Calculator

This project calculates the **minimum total payment** for a list of product prices, each associated with one or more tags, by applying a set of available discounts.

## üì¶ Input Format

- **Product Prices**: Each price is represented as a set:  
  `{ basePrice, tag1, tag2, ... }`

- **Discounts**: Each discount is defined as:  
  `{ tag, type, amount }`

## üè∑Ô∏è Discount Types

There are three types of discounts:

1. **Type 1** ‚Äì *Fixed Final Price*:  
   The product can be purchased at a fixed price, regardless of the base price.

2. **Type 2** ‚Äì *Fixed Discount*:  
   A fixed amount is subtracted from the base price.

3. **Type 3** ‚Äì *Percentage Discount*:  
   A percentage is subtracted from the base price.

## Implementation Overview

This solution is inspired by the **MapReduce** paradigm:

- **Map Phase**:  
  For each product price, generate all possible discounted prices by applying relevant discounts.

- **Emit Phase**:  
  For each product, emit the **minimum** price from the set of possible discounted prices.

- **Reduce Phase**:  
  Aggregate all minimum prices to compute the **total minimum payment**.

## Output

The final result is the **lowest total cost** achievable after applying the best combination of discounts to each product.

Usage:
```
mvnd test
```

Notes to myself for reproducing a similar project using Java.

Impl time: ~40m

You can scaffold a simple test-implementation maven project by using:
```
mvn archetype:generate \
-DgroupId=theia \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
-DinteractiveMode=false \
-DjavaCompilerVersion=23 \
-DartifactId=nubank-mapreduce
```
Might need to change to manually add the java version:
```
  <properties>
     <maven.compiler.source>23</maven.compiler.source>
     <maven.compiler.target>23</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>
```

Use sdkman to use a mvn version (or mvnd) and java version. Zulu has good performance.
